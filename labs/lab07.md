title: "Lab 7: For loops"
---

Today's lab is to do the following CloudCoder exercises:

* Week5 &rarr; [multiples](https://cs.ycp.edu/cloudcoder/#exercise?c=15,p=514)
* Week5 &rarr; [estimate pi](https://cs.ycp.edu/cloudcoder/#exercise?c=15,p=515)
* Week5 &rarr; [Fibonacci sequence](https://cs.ycp.edu/cloudcoder/#exercise?c=15,p=516)

As the design artifact for the lab, please complete a design for the [multiples](https://cs.ycp.edu/cloudcoder/#exercise?c=15,p=514) exercise only.

If you complete each of these exercises, congratulations &mdash; you are well on your way to using loops effectively.
